# final_project

This final project belongs to Emre Yener and it will be a solo project. The name of the project is "Rating Prediction of BestBuy Laptop Reviews". The purpose of the project is to scrape the BestBuy laptop reviews from the website and analyze the data. After the analysis, natural language processing will be applied to calculate TF-IDF scores on relevant words and a program will be created to predict ratings of each review out of five and compared with the actual ratings given to the product with each review. Ratings are integers ranging from one to five.
